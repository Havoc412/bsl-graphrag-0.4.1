But since it's not explicitly mentioned in the entity specification, we will ignore it for now.\n\n**Step 2: Extract claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no entities that match the specified types, there are no claims to extract.\n\nHowever, I can extract some general information from the text:\n\n* The text mentions \"收养一只被虐待过的猫咪\" (adopting a cat that has been abused) which could be related to an event or a situation.\n* The text also mentions \"给它最好的生活质量，让它不再受苦不是吗？\" (giving it the best living quality, so it won't suffer anymore) which could be related to a claim about providing good care for an animal.\n\nBut since there are no explicit entities mentioned in the text that match the entity specification, we will ignore these general information and move on to the next step.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as required**\n\nSince there are no claims to extract, there is nothing to format.\n\n**Step 4: Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified**\n\nThe output is an empty list since there are no claims to extract.\n\n**Output**\n\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that this output is different from the expected output because there were no entities that matched the specified types, and therefore no claims could be extracted.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.
