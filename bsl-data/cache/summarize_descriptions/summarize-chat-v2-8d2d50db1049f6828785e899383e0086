{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\nThe CONTAINS and COMMON_FRAG_MOLS.CSV entities are related to molecular fragments. Specifically, they contain information about molecules that can be represented as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. These molecules are broken down into smaller fragments, which are stored in the COMMON_FRAG_MOLS.CSV file. Each fragment is a distinct molecule with its own unique properties and characteristics.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by assuming that the CONTAINS entity is a container or database that holds information about molecular fragments, while the COMMON_FRAG_MOLS.CSV file is a specific dataset within that container that contains the actual fragment data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
