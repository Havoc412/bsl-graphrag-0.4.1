{"result": "Here is a comprehensive summary of the data:\n\n**CONTAINS**\n\nThe CONTAINS entity refers to a compound or substance that contains one or more molecules. It can be described as a **Drug**, which implies its potential therapeutic use, and also as a **Molecule**, indicating its chemical composition. Furthermore, it can be represented by a unique string of characters known as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), which provides a concise and standardized way to describe the molecular structure.\n\nNote: I have resolved any potential contradictions by considering the CONTAINS entity as a compound or substance that contains molecules, rather than being a molecule itself. This allows for the inclusion of both \"Drug\" and \"Molecule\" descriptions in the summary.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
