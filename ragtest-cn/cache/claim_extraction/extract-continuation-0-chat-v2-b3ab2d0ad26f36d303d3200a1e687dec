Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We need to extract all named entities that match these types from the text.\n\nAfter analyzing the text, we can identify the following entities:\n\n* Organization: None\n* Person: None\n* Geo: None\n* Event: None\n\nHowever, there are some phrases that could be related to events or organizations, but they don't match the exact entity types specified. For example, \"竞争性结合\" (Competitive binding) and \"共价键形成\" (Covalent bond formation) could be related to events, but they are not specific enough.\n\n**Step 2: Extract all claims associated with each entity**\n\nSince there are no entities that match the specification, we can't extract any claims. However, we can still analyze the text and identify some relevant information that could be used for information discovery.\n\nThe text mentions \"这些关系对于理解药物的作用机制以及设计新药都至关重要\" (These relationships are crucial for understanding the mechanism of action of drugs and designing new drugs). This sentence implies that there might be some claims or facts related to drug mechanisms and design, but they are not explicitly stated.\n\n**Step 3: Format each claim as required**\n\nSince we didn't find any entities that match the specification, we can't format any claims.
