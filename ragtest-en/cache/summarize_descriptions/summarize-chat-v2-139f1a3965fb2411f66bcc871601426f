{"result": "Here is a comprehensive description of BERT:\n\nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained language model that utilizes the transformer architecture. This model has been designed to leverage the strengths of the transformer architecture, which enables it to effectively capture contextual relationships between words in a sentence. As a result, BERT has become a widely used and influential tool in the field of natural language processing (NLP).", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
